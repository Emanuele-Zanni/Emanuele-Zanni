### ðŸ›  Highlighted Projects

1. **[Cocodrinks](https://cocodrinks.netlify.app):** Independent development of the frontend and backend for a small business.  
   - **Frontend:** Built with Astro and React, fully responsive for three main resolutions (Mobile, Tablet, and Desktop). Custom components (shopping cart, sidebar, header) designed in collaboration with a design team.  
   - **Backend:** Implemented in NestJS with a simple structure that includes secure authentication for a protected route `/admin`. From this panel, products are managed (creation, editing, activation/deactivation, and deletion), and it supports image uploads to the server using Multer. Authentication is based on a secret key stored in environment variables.  

2. **[Dionisio Wine Company](https://dionisiowines.netlify.app):** Group practice project for the development of a complete e-commerce platform.
   - **[Frontend](https://github.com/Emanuele-Zanni/Dionisio-Wine-Company-Frontend):**
     Developed using Next.js and React, with dynamic alerts implemented using SweetAlert2, payment processing with Stripe, and image management with NextCloudinary. We integrated mailing with Nodemailer, cookie handling with js-cookie, and complete styling with TailwindCSS. Deployment was done on Netlify.
   - **[Backend](https://github.com/Euka-e/Dionisio-Wine-Company-Backend):**
     Built with NestJS and TypeORM, using PostgreSQL for product, discount, and category management. Authentication was implemented through self-registration (email and password) and third-party providers (Google, GitHub), user role management, and payment processing with Stripe. Multer was also integrated for image uploads to Cloudinary, password encryption with bcrypt, and an automated mailing system with Nodemailer and CRON Jobs. API documentation was done with Swagger. The backend was deployed on Render.
